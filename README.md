## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This repo contains

- Firmware
- Circuit
- Detailed instructions

for Media Scheduler.



## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your system. The flowchart of the system is given below:


### Prerequisites

Things you need to install the FW.

```
- 1x Raspberry Pi 3B or 4
```

### Installation <a name = "installation"></a>

A step by step series that tell you how to get the Firmware and Backend running

#### Raspberry Pi Zero W Configuration

  1. Download and install Raspberry Pi Imager from here https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/
  2. Donwload "Raspberry Pi OS with desktop and recommended software" from here https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/operating-systems/
  3. Then extract the dowloaded image file using any extraction software like 7-zip https://www.7-zip.org/
  4. Put a 16 GB SD Card in your Laptop/PC.
  5. Open the Raspberry Pi imager, Click on "Choose OS" button and scroll down to select "Use Custom" as shown below
![Board](Artwork/rpiImager.png)
  6. Then select the extracted image file.
  7. In the next step select your SD Card and then click on "Write" button to start the writing process.
  8.  That‚Äôs it. It should be flashed within a few minutes.
  9.  Download this repository and open the configFiles folder of the repository and open wpa_supplicant.conf file and add your WiFi credentials in it.

####  Libraries Installation and Hostname/mDNS address change

  10. Once done, remove the SD Card and re-insert it into your PC/Laptop and then open the "boot" volume. Copy the files of "configFiles" folder here in the "boot" volume. Also create an empty file named "ssh" in the "boot" volume if not already present.
  11. Do the same steps for 2nd SD Card as well.
  12. Then put the SD Card in the first Raspberry Pi Zero and power it on.
  13. Then SSH into the Raspberry Pi which you can using the command ``ssh pi@raspberrypi.local``
  14. Once you are logged in, execute the following commands
  15. ```sudo apt install ufw```
  16. ```sudo ufw allow 22; sudo ufw allow 80; sudo ufw allow 443```
  17. ```sudo ufw enable```
  18. Now restart both Raspberry Pi

## WebApp <a name = "webapp"></a>



## Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

1.  Upload the code to your Raspberry Pi as mentioned in the [Installlation](#installation) section above.
2.  Now connect the circuit components as mentioned in [Circuit](#circuit) section above.
3.  Open terminal and SSH into both Raspberry Pis in different terminals.
4.  ``ssh pi@raspberrypi1.local`` while the password is 'pi'
5.  Open ```/home/pi/Firmware/Receiver/main.py```
